## What is Qualitative Research?    

As defined by Creswell in 2007, qualitative research, 

_"begins with assumptions, a worldview, the possible use of a theoretical lens, and the study of research problems inquiring into the meaning individuals or groups ascribe to a social or human problem. To study this problem, qualitative researchers use an emerging qualitative approach to inquiry, the collection of data in a natural setting sensitive to the people and places under study, and data analysis that is inductive and establishes patterns or themes. The final written report or presentation
includes the voices of participants, the reflexivity of the researcher, and a complex description and interpretation of the problem, and it extends the literature or signals a call for action."_ 

## Philosophical Assumptions  
* The research process begins with an introspective assessment of the philosophical assumptions the researcher is making in the study.  

* Researchers bring their own worldviews, beliefs, and experiences to their research.  

* Good research practice is to disclose the philosophical assumptions you are making in the research.  

## The Five Assumptions  

Five philsophical assumptions lead to an individual's choice of qualitative research:  

* ontology (nature of reality)    
* epistemology (acquisition of knowledge)    
* axiology (role of values)  
* rhetorical (language)  
* methodological (methods)  

## Paradigms or Worldviews  

* A paradigm is "a basic set of beliefs that guide action". (Guba, 1990)  

* These are often call paradigms, philosophical assumptions, research methodologies, and alternative knowledge claims.  
 
* Individuals may use multiple paradigms in their research that are compatible, as we will see.  

## Postpositivism  

* Research using this belief system take a scientific approach to research.  

* This belief has elements of being, 
    + reductionist  
    + logical  
    + empirical (data collection)  
    + cause-and-effect oriented, and  
    + deterministic (based on prior theories).
